## Introduction
This repository showcases the work done during the CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship. It includes three primary tasks:
1. Movie Genre Classification 🎬
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
3. Spam SMS Detection 📱

Each task involves creating a machine learning model using different techniques and algorithms to achieve the desired results.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification 🎬
The goal of this task is to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. We use techniques like TF-IDF for text vectorization and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

#### Dataset 📂
The dataset contains movie titles, genres, and plot summaries. You can download the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

#### Approach 🛠️
1. Preprocess the text data by cleaning and tokenizing.
2. Vectorize the text data using TF-IDF.
3. Train and evaluate models using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
The objective is to build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

#### Dataset 📂
The dataset contains information about credit card transactions, including various transaction attributes and a label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent. You can download the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

#### Approach 🛠️
1. Preprocess the dataset.
2. Train and evaluate models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
3. Evaluate the performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 3: Spam SMS Detection 📱
The goal is to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. We use techniques like TF-IDF for text vectorization and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

#### Dataset 📂
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as spam or legitimate. You can download the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

#### Approach 🛠️
1. Preprocess the text data.
2. Vectorize the text data using TF-IDF.
3. Train and evaluate models using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers.

## Installation 🛠️
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀
To run the models for each task, follow the instructions below:

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification 🎬
1. Navigate to the `movie_genre_classification` directory.
2. Run the `movie_genre_classification.py` script:

```bash
python movie_genre_classification.py
```

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳
1. Navigate to the `credit_card_fraud_detection` directory.
2. Run the `credit_card_fraud_detection.py` script:

```bash
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py
```

### Task 3: Spam SMS Detection 📱
1. Navigate to the `spam_sms_detection` directory.
2. Run the `spam_sms_detection.py` script:

```bash
python spam_sms_detection.py
```

## Results 📊
